## Overview

Sushi Gateway is a Level 7 API Gateway designed to manage, secure, and route API traffic between clients and services.

## Core Functionality

As a Level 7 API Gateway, Sushi Gateway operates at the application layer, which allows it to inspect, modify, and route HTTP traffic with high granularity. This capability is crucial for implementing sophisticated routing rules, security policies, and various service integrations.

## Custom Plugin Architecture

One of the core features of Sushi Gateway is its custom plugin architecture. This feature enables users to extend the gatewayâ€™s functionality by adding custom plugins to the middleware chain. These plugins can perform a wide range of functions, including:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensuring that only authorized users can access certain APIs.
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing API abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a certain period.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Keeping track of API usage and performance, which is crucial for troubleshooting and optimizing the system.

## Benefits of Sushi Gateway

Sushi Gateway offers several advantages for organizations looking to enhance their API management:

- **Flexibility**: Users can tailor the gateway to their specific needs by developing and integrating custom plugins.
- **Security**: With built-in support for AI-driven security log analysis, the gateway can preemptively detect and mitigate potential threats.
- **Performance**: Designed to handle requests in a non-blocking manner, Sushi Gateway ensures optimal performance even under high loads.
